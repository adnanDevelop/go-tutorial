Array?
Array are used to store multiple values in a single variable instead of creating separate variable for each value. There are two ways to declare an array
1: Using var keyword        2: := Using walrus operator

var student = [2]int{"adnan", "Hanan"} Here we declared the length of array.
var student = [..]int{"adnan", "Hanan"} Here we didn't give the length of array. Now length is inferred

The length specifies the number of elements to store in the array. In Go arrays have fixed length. The length of the array is either defined by a number or is inferred(means that compilor decides the length of the array based on the number of values).

If an array or one of its elements has not been initialized in the code, it is assigned the default value of its type.
